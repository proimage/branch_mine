BRANCH MINE
===========

ComputerCraft Turtle program for creating branch mines. Variable main trunk size & length, branch spacing & length - all controlled via an interactive text menu.

Some functions taken from the 'tunnel' program included with ComputerCraft / Feed The Beast.

Installation
------------
Open the ComputerCraft Zip archive in something like 7-Zip and place the "branch_mine" file (not folder!) in the /lua/rom/programs/turtle/ directory. This will make the program available to all your turtles in all your worlds.

Specific Installation Instructions for Feed The Beast:
1. Run the launcher.
2. Click the "Edit Mod Pack" button under the MODPACKS tab.
3. In the window that opens up, click the "Open Folder" button in the bottom-left.
4. In the Explorer window that loads up, find and open the ComputerCraft1.46.zip (or whichever version you're using), and follow the directions above (place the program in the Zip archive).

Usage
-----
Just run the "build_mine" program on a mining turtle (the one with a pickaxe). The main menu will appear - look through the options and get things to your liking - everything's fairly self-explanatory.

Fuel (coal) goes in slot 1, and cobblestone in slot 2. I recommend you fill the rest of the turtle's inventory with single "placeholders" (a block of ore, a diamond, a piece of redstone dust, etc) that you want the turtle to reserve space for, otherwise it'll fill up on cobblestone and discard all the valuables.

Make sure to run this program at the beginning of your Minecraft session so that it has time to complete. Exiting the Minecraft world will interrupt the program, and the turtle will not resume upon reload.
